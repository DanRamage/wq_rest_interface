					<strong>What is Enterococci?</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					Enterococci are bacteria that normally inhabit the intestinal tract of humans and animals. The presence of these bacteria can be an indication of fecal pollution, which may come from stormwater runoff, pets and wildlife, and human sewage. If they are present in high concentrations in recreational waters, it is more likely that pathogens that cause disease, infections or rashes may also be present. These pathogens can cause harm if they are  ingested while swimming or enter the skin through a cut or sore.

			<h3>&nbsp;Forecast</h3>
				<h3>What is the forecast?</h3>
					<p>Bacteria levels can change very rapidly between sampling dates. To fill in the gaps, we make daily predictions of bacteria conditions. <strong>These predictions do not represent swimming advisories</strong>, but provide estimates of the likelihood that bacteria conditions would warrant issuing an advisory if sampling were conducted that day.</p><p><strong>These forecasts are for informational purposes only</strong></p>
					<p>The probability that today's bacteria level will exceed the safe swimming standard based on an automated prediction system.</p>
                    <p>
                        <img src="/static/images/none_marker.png" /> No forecast available<br />
                        <img src="/static/images/low_marker.png" /> Low<br />
                        <img src="/static/images/medium_marker.png" /> Medium<br />
                        <img src="/static/images/high_marker.png" /> High<br />
                    </p>
				    <h3>How is the forecast generated?</h3>
					   <p>Predictions are made based on relationships between bacteria level and rainfall, salinity, wind conditions, and water temperature found in previous sampling. These relationships are used to create daily estimates of bacteria level.</p>

				<h3>&nbsp;Swim Advisory</h3>
					<p>The <a href="http://www.floridahealth.gov/environmental-health/beach-water-quality" target="_blank">Bureau of Environmental Health, Water Programs</a> issues a swimming advisory if the results exceed the EPA recommended water quality standard of 104 bacteria per 100 mL of water.
						An advisory is not a closure, but the Bureau of Environmental Health, Water Programs does not recommend swimming where an advisory has been issued.</p>
					<p><img src="/static/images/low_marker.png" /> None: there is no swimming advisory issued and it is considered safe to swim at this beach<br />
					<img src="/static/images/high_marker.png" /> Yes: an advisory is current<br />

				<h3>&nbsp;Data</h3>
					<h3>Sarasota Sampling Program</h3>
					<p>The <a href="http://www.floridahealth.gov/environmental-health/beach-water-quality/county-detail.html?County=Sarasota&Zip=34237" target="_blank">Sarasota County Beaches</a></p>
					<h3>Manatee Sampling Program</h3>

					<h3>Indicators</h3>
					<p>
						In 1998, five of Florida's coastal counties began monitoring for enterococci bacteria under a grant-funded pilot program. By the beginning of 2000, 11 Florida counties were participating in the program, which continued through July 2000.
					</p>
					<p>
						In August 2000, the Beach Water Sampling Program was extended to 34 of Florida's coastal counties through state legislation (Senate Bill 1412 and House Bill 2145) and funding. In addition, sampling under the new program now includes fecal coliform as well as enterococci bacteria. The rationale for selecting these two bacteria for analysis and implications of the sampling results are described below. In August 2002, the beach water sampling program began collecting water samples on a weekly basis with additional funding from U.S. EPA.
